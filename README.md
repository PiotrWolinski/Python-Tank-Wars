# Python-Tank-Wars
# Python-Tank-Wars Actually it will be pretty simple 2D tank game made in Python using pygame.   Some basic features im planning to implement:  - moving on the map freely and smoothly   - shooting  - destroying some stuff (but at this moment can't say what stuff)    To be honest I'm doing it just to learn some new things about Python and pygame  and not be bored at the same time
